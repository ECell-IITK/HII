        <p>
          <strong>
            Mr Ajay Dubey (BT/CHE/1980) esteemed alumnus of IIT Kanpur, has
            implemented Ajay and Rooma Dubey Health Tech Innovation and Ideation
            Grant (HII Program) with his generous contribution.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Health technology is defined as "application of organized knowledge
          and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures,
          and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of
          lives".
        </p>
        <p>
          HII program is to support students of IITK in the field of Healthtech
          innovation to convert their ideas into reality. Young minds are a
          treasure of innovation and thriving ideas. Through this program, such
          talented students will get a chance to prove their talent and convert
          their project ideas to develop product design prototypes. The
          stalwarts and big businesses of today were at one time just mere ideas
          of innovation. These ideas were supported and encouraged to cause
          market disruption and they lead to the success that the world sees
          today.

          <h1>Why health tech?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>
            Health tech is a delightful amalgamation of healthcare with modern
            technology to plain-sail the journey of saving millions of lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a rising sun setting new bars for the existing poor healthcare
            standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poor care quality leads to more deaths than insufficient access to
            healthcare. 1.6 million Indians died due to poor quality of care in
            2016, nearly twice as many as due to the non-utilization of
            healthcare services - (The Lancet).
          </p>
          <p>
            Focusing primarily on this sector can bring young innovators on
            board, help them relinquish the emerging healthcare market, and
            cater to 1.5 billion Indians.
          </p>
          <p>
            The poor healthcare sector is a misery with no end unless it's
            looked after.

                  SIB SHInE has been a wonderful experience so far. During the
                  clinical immersion, I got the opportunity to witness medical
                  practices (something rare for people outside the field) which
                  exposed a lot of problem points for patients and doctors. This
                  helped me shape an idea which I'm now pursuing to solve a
                  genuine problem for millions

                  As a fellow in this program, I got the chance to experience
                  the work with doctors there by able to identify few gaps where
                  there is actually a great need for new innovation for better
                  treatment and diagnosis during first three months of the
                  program. By taking up the problems and gaps we started finding
                  the possible solutions for betterment by working with
                  engineering professionals. It is always a great opportunity to
                  be guided and mentored by doctors and engineers with which
                  development of new biomedical equipment will be possible with
                  better outcomes.

                  As per the sights of the emerging engineering student, we
                  really feel there are a lot more things that can be modified
                  or changed in order to help the doctors and the patients. The
                  only thing is we empathize with them, feel the actual problem,
                  live with the problem, and try to solve the issues. I am not
                  saying everything you need to solve, but try to take that
                  problem that you really think you can do. You have full
                  support from IITK and doctors. Our society needs us, and this
                  sector is the most immersive sector today.
